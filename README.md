The current urban traffic system tends to be perfect, but there are still many problems
such as traffic jams and vehicles that cannot avoid each other. The traffic environment is
complex and changeable, and the safety and security of personnel is becoming more and more
urgent. Machine-to-vehicle recognition can help people quickly learn about traffic conditions
in ordinary events or emergencies. Video detection technology has many advantages, such as
strong intuition, large detection range, more available information, and low cost. In future
intelligent transportation systems, deep learning target detection technology can help
machines identify vehicles, judge road conditions, and support corresponding
decision-making, which is one of the basic requirements for autonomous driving in the future. This paper will introduce the theoretical basis of convolutional neural network and YOLO
algorithm based on deep learning-based vehicle video detection technology, and will use
YOLO models of different scales to carry out comparative experiments to test models of
different scales in different weather and different lighting conditions. The robustness and
comprehensive performance under the condition are drawn, and the conclusions of the YOLO
model in different practical application scenarios are drawn.
